Oh. My. God. Just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Parenting, and I’m, like, honestly at a loss for words 😂 The emotional rollercoaster was real, man. One minute I’m laughing, the next I’m all teary-eyed, and then I’m laughing again… it’s like they’re messing with my feelings on purpose, you know what I mean?

Seriously though, who knew parenting could be that chaotic? It’s both terrifying and heartwarming at the same time! I mean, I went in expecting to chill and unwind, and ended up needing a whole therapy session, lol. Can’t decide if it’s making me more excited or scared for the future.

> Like, the bit where the kid throws spaghetti everywhere? Hilarious and tragic simultaneously. Can’t stop thinking about how I’d handle that. Probably just move to a new house 😂 Hey, remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you haven’t already, it’s definitely worth it.

Anyway, there was this part that just spoke to me. Like, they nailed how weird and challenging the whole responsibility thing is. Feels like they got right into my brain! How do they capture these tiny, mundane things and make them so deep? Witchcraft, I swear. Just when I thought they’d go for easy laughs, they hit you with those feels.

Also, when the parents finally 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬 and break into that dance routine?? Iconic. Worth the entire 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. Makes me wanna bust a move in my living room. Possessed by the spirit of tired parents everywhere or something, haha.
